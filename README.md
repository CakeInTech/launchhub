## Credits
This project was inspired and guided by [@jsMastery](https://github.com/adrianhajdin), a fantastic YouTube channel for learning modern technologies like Next.js. Special thanks to Adrian for the tutorials, which were instrumental in building LaunchHub.

Additionally, this project utilized **Sanity.io** as the backend for managing and storing content. Sanity's powerful APIs and flexible content schema made it an ideal choice for this project.

This project also provided a hands-on opportunity to dive deep into Next.js and explore its advanced features, including:
- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Static site generation (SSG)
- API routes
- Performance optimizations
- Third-party authentication with GitHub
